### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm TJ from Tanzania and currently PhD student in Internet of Things hosted at African Centre of Excellence in IoT - University of Rwanda.
ðŸ”­ My work is focused on asymptomatic early disease detection on Maize crops in Sub Saharan Region by using IoT sensors in integrat (Chatbot) to communicate these captured information to farmers. 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on generating the datasets for maize crop  disease patterns on the following parameters; Emmitted Volatile Organic Compounds, Fertilizer Consumption(NPK), Ultra Sound, Humidity and Temperature around the plant.
